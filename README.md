# Controller and component Instructions

textConsultation is an angularJS component.
PatientComponent, DetailsComponent, are angular 7 component.

# To use PatientComponent in textConsultation, we need to downgread the PatientCompoenent -

.directive(
  'appPatient',
  downgradeComponent({ component: PatientComponent }) as angular.IDirectiveFactory
);

# and use it as a directive inside angularJs componentâ€™s html -
<div><b>Text Consultation Component</b><app-patient></app-patient></div>

# Need to import UIRouterUpgradeModule.forRoot() from '@uirouter/angular-hybrid'.

Like DetailsComponent, we can use  PatientComponent, directly in the routing as well. Then we need to make it as entry component in the ngModule declaration.


imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    UpgradeModule,
    UIRouterUpgradeModule.forRoot(),
  ],
entryComponents: [
PatientComponent,
DetailsComponent,
]

# inside package.json -
 Add dependencies of @angular/upgrade, @uirouter/angular-hybrid, angular (angular js)
